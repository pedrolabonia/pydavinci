# Premiere Proxies

We all know about Premieres __particular__ need for proxies.

They have to be:

-   :material-aspect-ratio:{ .lg .middle } __Same aspect ratio as the original files__

        Otherwise you end up with stretched proxies, and no one likes that.

    ---

-   :material-cast-audio:{ .lg .middle } __Same number of audio tracks as the original files__

        This doesn't make sense, but that's how it is.

    ---

-   :material-timeline-clock-outline:{ .lg .middle } __Ideally same timecode__

        Because otherwise you're going to have headaches.

So you end up having to:

-   Create proxies in Premiere and hope you have a nice 16x9 aspect ratio because that's what the default presets use.
-   Realize you have media mixed between DCI 4k and UHD and now you gotta create an individual encoding preset
-   Realize you have to create a Media Encoder encoding preset :face_with_spiral_eyes:

If you ever had to do that at 2am you know that it works so badly it's not even funny. You create the preset and it tries to copy the files, or it can't import the preset into Premiere, or a thousand other weird things.

Then you decide to do just transcode everything in Davinci Resolve, which is probably what you should've done in the first place, but you still need to render everything in the same aspect ratio.

Let's fix that and hopefully come home early :partying_face:

## The code

### Importing pydavinci

Assuming we have ``pydavinci`` installed, let's create a ``premiere_proxies.py`` file and import and define the variables we're going to use

```py title="premiere_proxies.py"
from pydavinci import Resolve

resolve = Resolve()

project = resolve.project
project_manager = resolve.project_manager
media_pool = resolve.media_pool
media_storage = resolve.media_storage
```

### Setting up a folder to import to
Now let's create a folder on the root folder, and set it as the current folder

```py
ocf_folder = media_pool.add_subfolder(media_pool.root_folder, 'OCF')
media_pool.set_current_folder(ocf_folder)
```

!!! info
    OCF means _Original Camera Format_, and it's a naming standard we all should use!

### Defining our function

Let's define our function to generate the Premiere proxies:

```py
def generate_premiere_proxies(input_dir, proxyfactor, output_dir):
```
Our function will take as parameters:

- `input_dir`: a path to a folder containing all our media
- `output_dir`: output directory for our proxies
- `proxyfactor`: by how much we will reduce the resolution for the proxies

!!! info
    `proxyfactor` is the number to divide the original resolution to.

    __Example:__  
    A `proxyfactor` of `2` on a `1920x1080` resolution will give you a `960x540` resolution proxy
    A `proxyfactor` of `1` on a `1920x1080` resolution will give you a `1920x1080` resolution proxy.  
    A `proxyfactor` of `1.5` on a `1920x1080` resolution will give you a `1280x720` resolution proxy.  

#### Importing Media
Now we can import the media in our project, and figure out what resolutions they are

```py
def generate_premiere_proxies(input_dir, proxyfactor, output_dir):
    media_pool.import_media(input_dir)
    clips_res = defaultdict(list)

    for media in ocf_folder.clips:
            clips_res[media.properties['Resolution']].append(media)

```

We first import our media using the `media_pool.import_media` method, which imports all valid(as judged by Resolve) media files from ``input_dir`` into the media pool. We then create a ``defaultdict`` that we will use to store all resolutions from the media.

Then we loop for each `MediaPoolItem` in the `ocf_folder`. We access the clips contained in that `Folder` by using the `.clips` attribute.

!!! info
    We're using a `defaultdict` to simplify our loop. If we used a regular dict, the first time we find a resolution we would have to first initiate it with a list value and then append to it. This way we don't need to check if this is the first resolution we've seen or not.
